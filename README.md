# Flask Boilerplate for Junior Developers

Create flask API's in minutes, [ðŸ“¹ watch the video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ORxQ-K3BzQA).

- [Extensive documentation here](https://start.4geeksacademy.com).
- Integrated with Pipenv for package managing.
- Fast deployment to render.com or heroku with `$ pipenv run deploy`.
- Use of `.env` file.
- SQLAlchemy integration for database abstraction.

## 1) Installation

This template installs itself in a few seconds if you open it for free with Codespaces (recommended) or Gitpod.
Skip this installation steps and jump to step 2 if you decide to use any of those services.

> Important: The boiplerplate is made for python 3.10 but you can change the `python_version` on the Pipfile.

The following steps are automatically runned withing gitpod, if you are doing a local installation you have to do them manually:

```sh
pipenv install;
psql -U root -c 'CREATE DATABASE example;'
pipenv run init;
pipenv run migrate;
pipenv run upgrade;
```

> Note: Codespaces users can connect to psql by typing: `psql -h localhost -U gitpod example`

## 2) How to Start coding

There is an example API working with an example database. All your application code should be written inside the `./src/` folder.

- src/main.py (it's where your endpoints should be coded)
- src/models.py (your database tables and serialization logic)
- src/utils.py (some reusable classes and functions)
- src/admin.py (add your models to the admin and manage your data easily)

For a more detailed explanation, look for the tutorial inside the `docs` folder.

## Remember to migrate every time you change your models

You have to migrate and upgrade the migrations for every update you make to your models:

```bash
$ pipenv run migrate # (to make the migrations)
$ pipenv run upgrade  # (to update your databse with the migrations)
```

## Generate a database diagram

If you want to visualize the structure of your database in the form of a diagram, you can generate it with the following command:

```bash
$ pipenv run diagram
```

This command will generate a file with the database diagram based on the models defined in `src/models.py`.

## Check your API live

1. Once you run the `pipenv run start` command your API will start running live and you can open it by clicking in the "ports" tab and then clicking "open browser".

> âœ‹ If you are working on a coding cloud like [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#sharing-a-port) or [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/ports#configure-port-visibility) make sure that your forwared port is public.

## Publish/Deploy your website!

This boilerplate it's 100% read to deploy with Render.com and Herkou in a matter of minutes. Please read the [official documentation about it](https://start.4geeksacademy.com/deploy).
